            Do you ever find yourself at the mall and you lock eyes with the perfect garment that would work perfectly for your next Disneybound?
            So you buy it, you style it, you snap it, you post it, and then you hang it in your closet for normal everyday wear.
            Then you start to wonder, could I use this piece for any other bounds?  You start brainstorming a couple of other characters that 
            are the same color but you wish there was just a quick and simple list that you could reference? Then you have come to the right place.
            </p>

            Match the Magic is a quick pocket guide for Disney bounders made by a Disney bounder.

            I hope that you enjoy this website and that it helps you to find fun disneybounds that are already in your closet that you did not ever realize were there!
